### Output dataset:

File name: tidy_data_mean.txt

Columns (variables):

activityID ... activity id, values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

activityDesc ... the description of activities, values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,	SITTING,	STANDING,  LAYING

subject ... person id, values: 1, 2, ..., 30


Below are the means and standard deviations of 33 measured variables, averaged by activity and subject (see the descriptions of these variables below):
